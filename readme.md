<h1 align="center" style="border: 0;"> Neural Machine Translation communication system </h1>

The model is basically direct to convert one source language to another targeted language using encoder and decoder architecture. The model encodes the message sent by the sender to a vector of fixed length and decoder generates the translated message which is received by the receiver in their communication system(chat application) automatically.
